## Installation

As a normal Create React App, install `npx create-react-app my-app` in order to run this source code. View the official documentation to learn more: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

## Usage
Once updated, you can follow the scripts provided by Create React App: 
* `npm start` - runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
* `npm test` - launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
* `npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

## Technologies
Besides Create React App, this project was created with the following NPMs, here are the examples:
* `react-bootstrap` - for building the app more responsive and quicker.
* `react-multi-carousel` - for creating carousels. 
* `animate.css` - for creating some fun animations.
* `i18next` - for translating one language from another alongwith some JSON files I built.
